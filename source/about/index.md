# About Me

Hi, my name is Justin!

I'm a master student in Computer Science at National Tsing Hua University in LSALAB studying networking and distributed systems (especially eBPF). I'm also a Backend Intern at Dcard currently.

I like to learn new things and share my knowledge with others, this is why this blog exists and why I've been TA for many courses including Introduction to Compter Science, Operating System, and Distributed System.

Previously I participated in lots of competitive programming contests and got several awards. For example 2019 ICPC Asia Pacific Taipei-Hsinchu Regional Contest 4th-place, and 2020 ICPC World Finals Invitational Contest Rank 22. Now I practice LeetCode every day to keep my coding skills sharp and its been 700 days since I started 👍. See my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/justin0u0/) and [Github repo](https://github.com/justin0u0/LeetCode) for more details.

This is my CV if you are interested in my background [CV](/assets/CV.pdf).

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions via [e-mail](mailto:mail@justin0u0.com).
